There are many ways to build a portfolio. Previously, I used WordPress for my portfolio website, but I encountered many issues, such as slow loading times and the need to install multiple plugins to manage the site. Eventually, I became lazy to write articles.

Then, I discovered Jekyll. It's super fast and interesting enough for me to build my portfolio on this platform. However, building it from scratch took a lot of time. So, I searched for a theme I liked and used GitHub to host my website.

Jekyll is a static site generator that takes markdown or html files and converts them into a complete website. On this website, I use markdown and update it occasionally on Github. It generates static files that are fast, secure, and easy to manage. 

GitHub pages is a free hosting service provided by gitHub that allows users to publish static websites directly from a Github repository. I can create a repository and publish my website directly using Github pages. If you have your own domain, you can use that as well.

For this website, I am using the Tailpages theme from Jekyll. You can check out the theme here:
