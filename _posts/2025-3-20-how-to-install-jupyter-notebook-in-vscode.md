title: How to install Jupyter Notebook in VSCode

Before this, I was doing data analysis using Jupyter Notebook in Anaconda. Then, I stumbled upon a tutorial that used Jupyter in VSCode. I thought it would be easier to write code in VSCode than in Anaconda, so I wrote this tutorial to share the process since it only requires three steps.

Before installing Jupyter in VSCode, make sure you have:

- `VSCode installed` â€“ You can download it from [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- `Python installed` â€“ Get it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and make sure to add it to your systemâ€™s PATH.

### Step 1: Install the Jupyter Extension in VSCode

1. Open `VSCode`.
2. Click on the `Extensions Marketplace`.
3. Search for `Jupyter`.
4. Click `Install` to add the extension.

### Step 2: Create a New Jupyter Notebook

1. Open `VSCode`.
2. Click `File > New File`.
3. Save the file with a `.ipynb` extension (for example, `my_notebook.ipynb`).
4. VSCode will detect it as a Jupyter Notebook automatically.
5. If you see a prompt, select the correct Python interpreter.

### Step 3: Run Jupyter Notebook in VSCode

1. Open a `.ipynb` file in VSCode.
2. Click the `Run Cell` button (looks like a play button) to execute a cell.
3. The output will appear right below the cell.
4. You can also use the `Jupyter interactive window` for more flexibility.


Thatâ€™s it! Now you have Jupyter Notebook running inside VSCode. ðŸš€
