### What is Jekyll?

Jekyll is a static site generator that takes Markdown or HTML files and converts them into a complete website. It is often used for blogs, documentation sites, and personal portfolios. Instead of using a database like traditional CMS platforms (e.g., WordPress), Jekyll generates static files that are fast, secure, and easy to manage.

#### Key Features of Jekyll

- **Static Site Generation:** Converts Markdown and HTML files into a structured website.  
- **Liquid Templating System:** Allows dynamic content with variables and includes.  
- **Built-in Blog Support:** Comes with an easy-to-use blogging framework.  
- **Flexible and Customizable:** Can be customized with themes, plugins, and configurations.  
- **Compatible with GitHub Pages:** Works seamlessly with GitHub Pages for free hosting.  

### What is GitHub Pages?

GitHub Pages is a free hosting service provided by GitHub that allows users to publish static websites directly from a GitHub repository. It is widely used for personal websites, project documentation, and open-source project pages.

#### Key Features of GitHub Pages

- **Free Hosting:** Host your static website at `https://your-username.github.io/`.  
- **Easy Deployment:** Websites are automatically published from a GitHub repository.  
- **Supports Jekyll:** GitHub Pages natively supports Jekyll, so you donâ€™t need a separate server.  
- **Custom Domain Support:** Use your own domain with GitHub Pages.

1. **Develop Locally with Jekyll** â€“ Write your content in Markdown or HTML, then use Jekyll to generate your site.  
2. **Push to GitHub Repository** â€“ Store your site files in a GitHub repository.  
3. **Enable GitHub Pages** â€“ GitHub automatically detects Jekyll and builds your site.  
4. **Access Your Site Online** â€“ Your site is live at `https://your-username.github.io/`.  

This combination makes Jekyll and GitHub Pages a powerful, easy-to-use platform for building and hosting static websites for free. ðŸš€
